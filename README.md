#### Coursera Machine Learning Specialization

you can get this course by filing a good financial aid form in coursera ,[link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?adgroupid=156621904981&adposition=&aid=true&campaignid=21092529272&creativeid=693270366211&device=c&devicemodel=&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkKXnzZO9hgMVd2hBAh2C_QaVEAAYASAAEgJovPD_BwE&hide_mobile_promo&keyword=coursera+machine+learning&matchtype=p&network=g&utm_campaign=b2c_emea_machine-learning-introduction_stanford_ftcof_specializations_arte_march_24_dr_geo-multi-set2_sem_rsa_gads_lg-all&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg).
after filling the form u will have to wait 16 days exactly and if you fill the form well (not generate content from chatgpt) you will surely have the course for free, i suggest you do financial aid for every possible course in this list, , to not leave you waiting 16 to start grinding , here's a youtube collection of the first course , you can start right away: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFX8k1kXhOw&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b)
