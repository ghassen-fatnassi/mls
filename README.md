### Frameworks and Tools

1. **scikit-learn**: For non-deep learning tasks like linear regression, K-means, KNN, decision trees, random forests, and SVM.
2. **PyTorch**: For deep learning tasks. [Learn PyTorch](https://learnpytorch.io) - this is an extensive course that covers various aspects of deep learning: math, programming, and GPUs.
   - Additional frameworks for working with data include `pandas` and `cv2`. These can be learned along the way.
3. **Kaggle Competitions**: The best way to practice machine learning. Engage in challenges, learn from othersâ€™ submissions, and integrate with the AI community.
