   - [Video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=4)

3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Description**: Recommendation systems, and reinforcement learning. For more rigor and math, check these:
     - [MIT Course on Reinforcement Learning](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/courseware/Week10/reinforcement_learning/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B6.036%2B1T2019%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40reinforcement_learning)
     - [MIT Course on Recommender Systems](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/courseware/Week12/recommender_systems/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B6.036%2B1T2019%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40recommender_systems)
     - if wanna learn more about reinforcement learning , here's a well structured documentation from openAI personally [SpinningUp in DEEP RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)

#### Time to learn a framework to create those models with, I personally recommend this stack:

1. **scikit-learn** for non-deep learning tasks: linear regression, K-means, KNN, decision trees, random forests, SVM, etc.
2. **pytorch** for deep learning tasks, [my personal favorite source](https://learnpytorch.io) - this course is the richest course on the internet about pytorch. It really shows the effort put in to make deep learning accessible to all of us from various aspects: math, programming, and GPUs.
   - PS: You'll need some additional frameworks to work with data (pandas, cv2, etc.). No need to take a course on them, you'll learn them along the way.
3. **Grind Kaggle competitions** - This is the best way to start practicing machine learning. You'll learn a lot by taking on a challenge, trying to solve the same problem for a while, seeing others' submissions, and integrating yourself with the AI community.
